=====================================

## Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to successfully create unit tests for their C# console applications using the Red/Green/Refactor approach. 
* The students will understand and implement code coverage within their programs when testing
* Students will include intuitive comments within their code
* Students will setup readme documentation for each assignment given a specific format

# Lecture Outline

## Unit Tests TDD
 - What is TDD? 
 - What are Katas?

### What are Unit tests?
- Used to verify your code is working as expected
- Defend your position - Used as a justification
- Code Coverage - aim at 90%. 

### Demo
- Code Challenge: FizzBuzz
  - recreate using the TDD approach
  - Show how to install NuGet packages and add XUnit

## Documentation

### What is Documentation?
  - Why do we use it?
  - What are the different types?
	- Comments
	- README in github
	- How do we Create it?
		- Example of Readme
		- Example of Comments
