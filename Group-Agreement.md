# Midterm Project 

Time to kick off planning with your group! Today is the beginning of your project planning. Here's what you need to accomplish (in order):

### Select a project
As a group, Think up a project to create during project week. Use a whiteboard to collaboratively write out the following:
- Your project topic
- Your project pitch:
  - What is the problem you're solving?
  - What will be your solution to the problem?
  - What are the benefits to your solution?
  - You can read more about pitches  [here](https://www.bidsketch.com/proposal-resources/proposal-templates/web-design-proposal-template).
- Clearly and Cleanly draft up your project pitch idea in google document.
  - Invite Amanda (amanda@codefellows.com) to be a contributor to the document. 
  - Make sure all group members are invited to this document
  - Let Amanda know when your pitch is ready for review. 

### Group agreement
Now that you've had a chance to talk some as a group, step away from the project pitch to develop a group agreement. This is a document that your group creates collaboratively; it details your expectations of how you will work with each other. It is a "living document" - that is, it can be changed as you go along to meet your group's needs as they emerge. Again, develop this collaboratively and write it down together in a Google document. Make sure Everyone in your group is invited and contributing to the document. Keep refining it until everyone in the group agrees with it. At the minimum, it should cover:
      - Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
      - Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
      - Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the C#, MVC Core Framework, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
      - Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?
      - Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
  - Invite Amanda to the Google Document 
  - Once approved, the instructional team will direct you on next steps....
  
### GitHub setup
Next up: time to get set up in GitHub.
- Make an organization on GitHub for your team.
- Invite all team members to the Organizations.
- In that organization, create a repo for your project.
- In the README.md, add your group members' names, your project topic, and your project pitch.
- Add a `group-agreement.md`, with the text of your group agreement.
- Have one team member send the Github org link with Amanda.

### Review with the instructional team
Once you have the above things done, find Amanda and present your project pitch and group agreement. This is so we can make sure you're on track and not biting off an impossible project.
