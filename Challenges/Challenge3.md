Without using Visual Studio:
1. Design for me a system that will help organize a grocery store. 
2. This application is supposed to help shoppers know where everything is through some sore of app. 
	- For example, I need to find Green Beans, but I am unsure what aisle they are located. Can you come up with a solution?
3. What does the request Response cycle look like for this? (What happens when the customer says they are looking for bread?);
4. Is an MVC architectural pattern applicable? Why or why not?

4. Are you able to provide psudeo code of what *some* of the code would look like?
	- Specifically, I want to see what information gets sent to the server, and what information is sent back. 
	- Provide for me the method that will essentially give the user the aisle number. 

This question is open-ended for a reason. Use your troubleshooting and debugging skills to break this down and determine what
the best possible solution would look like.
