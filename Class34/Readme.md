## Coding Challenge

You are given a binary tree (not necessarily a binary search tree!) where each node is labeled with an integer. The path weight of a node in such a tree is the sum of the integers on the unique path from root to that node, including that node. Nodes do not contain references to their parents.

Write a function that takes a binary tree as an argument, as well as some integer. Check if there exists a leaf whose path weight equals the given integer. If there does, return True. Otherwise, return False.

- **Stretch**: Return every node with a path weight equal to the given integer sum
- **Stretch**: Consider the tree with negative and positive numbers

-Using your "data-structures" repository
  - add a folder and label it `Trees`
  - add the code on a branch from this challenge into this repo
  - Describe your approach in the strings folder readme document
  - Spend no more than 90 minutes on this challenge
  - Submit a link to your repo PR in canvas
