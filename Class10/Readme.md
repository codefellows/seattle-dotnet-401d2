=====================================

## Learning Objectives
1. Students will know how to implement recursion

## Lecture Outline

### Recursion
1. What is Recursion?
	- Recursion occurs when a method calls itself. 
		- direct: the method calls itself
		- indirect: method calls some other method that then calls the first method
1. Recursion is not a 'fix all' solution:
	- it can suffer performance of an applicaiton because of using call stack again and again is not always a good choice.
