## Models
1. What is a Model?
    - The model in an MVC application represents the state of the application and any buisness logic or operations that should be performed by it. 
    - Business logic should be encapsulated in the model, along with any implementation logic for persisting the state of the applicaiton. 
    - strongly typed views will typically use ViewModel types specifically designed to contain data to dispaly on that view. The controller will create and populate these viewmodels from the model. 

2. The model classes you'll create are known as POCO classes (from "plain-old CLR objects") because they don't have any dependency on EF Core. They just define the properties of the data that will be stored in the database.
