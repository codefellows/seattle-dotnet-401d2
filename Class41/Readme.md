## Coding Challenge

### Radix Sort
Merge sort is beaking an array down into smaller elements to eventually build it back up in a sorted final product.
Take a look at the visual algo demonstrations to visually see what it looks like, in addition to the Wiki 
<br />
**Try to figure this sorting algo out yourself before turning to the code located in the wiki**

- [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)
- [Radix Sort Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)

- What is the Time/Space effeciency of this sorthing algorithm? Why?
- Do this sorting algorithm "in place"

-Using your "data-structures" repository
  - add a folder and label it `Sorting Algorithms`
  - add the code on a branch from this challenge into this repo
  - Describe your approach in the strings folder readme document
  - Spend no more than 90 minutes on this challenge
  - Submit a link to your repo PR in canvas
