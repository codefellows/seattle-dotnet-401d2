# User Stories

## What are User Stories?
- Are short, simple, and open for interpretation
- Should clearly communicate the end goal of the user
- Includes Acceptance Testing

## INVEST In Your User Stories
- **Independent**: The user story should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story 
- **Negotiable**: user stories, up until they are part of an iteration, can always be changed and rewritten
- **Valuable** to users or Customers: a user story must deliver value to the end user
- **Estimable**: You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.
- **Small**: User stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize  with a certain level of certainty
- **Testable**: the user story or it's related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible. 

## What Does It Look like?
- "As a <\role>, I want <\goal> so that <\benefit>" 
- As a user, I want to search for my customers by their first and last names. 
- As a non-administrative user, I want to modify my own schedules but not the schedules of other users.
