## Selection Sort
Selection sort is a sorting algo that finds the smallest element in an array, places it at the beginning, finds the second smallest, places it in position 1....and so on until 
the array is sorted. 
<br />
**Try to figure this sorting algo out yourself before turning to the code located in the wiki**

- [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)
- [Selection Sort Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- What is the Time/Space effeciency of this sorthing algorithm? Why?
- Do this sorting algorithm "in place"

-Using your "data-structures" repository
  - add a folder and label it `Sorting Algorithms`
  - add the code on a branch from this challenge into this repo
  - Describe your approach in the strings folder readme document
  - Spend no more than 90 minutes on this challenge
  - Submit a link to your repo PR in canvas
