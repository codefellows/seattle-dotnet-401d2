=====================================

## Learning Objectives
1. Students will understand the concept and importance behind software design patterns
2. Students will be able to successfully implement and create their own Factory Design pattern


### Design Patterns
- What are design patterns?
	- Who is the Gang of Four?
- Different types of patterns
	- Creational
	- Behavioral
	- Structural

### Factory Design Pattern
	- What is the Factory Design Pattern?
		- Creational pattern that defines an 'interface' to construct an object
		- When using this pattern, you can define certain methods and properties of objects that will be common to all objects created
		- You have to let the factory methods define what specific objects will be instantiated
	- What is the "structure" of a factory design pattern?
		- Product Class
		- Concrete Product
		- Creator Class
		- Concrete Creator

#### Demo 
	- Create a pizza store factory method
	- Structure:
		- Product Class: Pizza
			- Concreate Product: Types of Pizza
		- Creator Class: Pizza Store
			- Concrete Creator: specific Pizza Stores (Domino's, Zeeks, etc...)
